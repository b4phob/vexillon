<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
We do not work for roblox neither do we control fastflags, these are made by roblox engineers to alter these values instead of launching a whole new client update. Altering these values yourself can improve gameplay and quality. We do not support using fastflags that gives you an unfair adventage. Never use fastflags you don't know about, doing so might break your game or client. We are not responsible for your actions if you ignore this.

Our app has a specific goal being configuring fastflags the way you want it, we are not like the other bootstrappers. Because of our specific goal we got features supporting it to give you the best user experience.

<h1>Features</h1>

### Library
<p>Save fastflags to your library to reinstall or copy them after overwriting your current flag list</p>

### Your in charge

### Sync
