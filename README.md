###### Future of configuring roblox flags

### Disclaimer
We do not work for roblox neither do we control flags, these are made by roblox engineers to alter these values instead of launching a whole new client update. Altering these values yourself can improve gameplay and quality. We do not support using flags that gives you an unfair adventage. Never use flags you don't know about, doing so might break your game or client.

Our app has a specific goal being configuring flags the way you want it, we are not like the other bootstrappers. Because of our specific goal we got features supporting it to give you the best user experience.
