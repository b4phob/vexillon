A guide for vexillon 1.1.0

---

<h1>How to Set Up</h1>

1. **Install Vexillon**: Download Vexillon from the official Discord server. Ensure you are on the correct server, linked at the end of this page.

2. **Antivirus Settings**: If you're using Avast, Kaspersky Pro, Zillya, AVG, or SecureAge, disable them temporarily. These programs might mistakenly flag Vexillon as malicious, while trusted antivirus solutions like MalwareBytes do not.

3. **Unzip and Run**: Unzip the downloaded file and open `vexillon.exe`. You will see a command prompt window and the main UI. Do not close the command prompt window as it runs the main script and displays errors. Once the main UI appears, you’re ready to go!

<h1>How It Works</h1>

1. **Importing Kits**: You can import a "Kit" from the Discord server to fill up your library tab, or manually fill the textbox yourself. To import a kit, locate the `saved` folder on the same directory as `vexillon.exe` and add the downloaded jsons to that folder.

2. **Submitting and saving files**: To import the file into Roblox, click Submit, only jsons are supported. Click "Save" to save the JSON data you’ve entered in the textbox. You can also add a file name using the Vexillon UI. **RESTART AFTER SUBMITTING**

3. **Disbanding JSON**: Click "Disband" to remove the currently installed JSON file.

4. **Combining JSONs**: To run multiple JSONs simultaneously, submit the first JSON and then add subsequent JSONs one by one by clicking "Combine" on each. This combines the JSONs into a single file.

5. **Restarting Roblox**: The "Restart" button restarts the Roblox client.

<h1>Errors and Suggestions</h1>

If it doesn't work its becausey ou need to restart Vexillon after submitting. If you encounter any other errors, you can ask the community for help on the Discord server, where a high-ranking member will assist you. To troubleshoot errors yourself, ensure that the `tmp` and `saved` folders are in the same directory as `Vexillon.exe`. Feel free to suggest improvements via the Discord server linked below!
